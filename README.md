# Mapish
## Wat?
Mapish simply lets you manage named locations while displaying a map based on the location's geocoded data. Cool.

Really, this was just an excuse to finally play around with Sinatra and Backbone. I wrote tests, made things RESTful, battled many bugs, and ended up with a toy that I'm pretty happy with.

## Try it out
If you want to try Mapish out yourself `clone` this repo, run `bundle`, and finally `rackup`.
Or just go [here](http://quiet-shelf-1077.herokuapp.com/) and give it a shot ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) takes a bit to load development instances, so be patient.)

## Stuff I Used
  * [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - Handles all the backend stuff.
  * [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) - Manages all client side interactions.
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - Responsive websites are hard. This makes it a tad easier!
  * [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Because who wants to write javascript?
  * [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) - Write tests. Do it.

## Want to help?
If you have any suggestions or want to fork the project and play on your own, feel free! This is all just for fun anyway.
